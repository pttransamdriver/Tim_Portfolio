# Interactive Charts - Deployment Guide for Hostinger

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your blog article "Getting Started with Agentic Coding" now includes **two interactive charts**:

1. **Hours Savings Bar Chart** - Shows time savings across different tasks
2. **Cost Savings Pie Chart** - Shows ROI analysis with a 25x return calculation

These charts are:
- ✅ Built with Recharts (professional, lightweight charting library)
- ✅ Fully responsive (mobile & desktop)
- ✅ Dark mode compatible
- ✅ Interactive (hover for tooltips)
- ✅ Load data from CSV files

## 🚀 Will It Work on Hostinger?

**YES!** Everything has been configured to work on your Hostinger hosting:

### What Was Updated:

1. **`.htaccess`** - Added CSV MIME type support
2. **`vite.config.ts`** - Configured to copy CSV files to build output
3. **Chart components** - Load data from `/content/data/*.csv`
4. **Blog article** - Includes chart markers that render as interactive components

## 📦 What Gets Deployed

Your `dist/` folder now includes:

```
dist/
├── .htaccess                      ← Updated with CSV support
├── content/
│   ├── blogs/
│   │   └── getting-started-with-agentic-coding.md  ← New blog post
│   └── data/                      ← NEW: Chart data folder
│       ├── Cost_Savings_Piechart.csv
│       └── Hours_Savings_Barchart.csv
└── assets/
    └── BlogPost-*.js              ← Now includes Recharts library
```

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Your Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Upload to Hostinger

Upload the **entire contents** of the `dist/` folder to your `public_html` directory, including:

**IMPORTANT - Don't forget these new files:**
- ✅ `.htaccess` (updated with CSV support)
- ✅ `content/data/` folder (new directory with CSV files)
- ✅ `content/blogs/getting-started-with-agentic-coding.md` (new blog post)
- ✅ All files in `assets/` (updated with chart library)

### 3. Verify After Upload

Check that these files exist on Hostinger:
```
public_html/
├── .htaccess
├── content/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── Cost_Savings_Piechart.csv
│   │   └── Hours_Savings_Barchart.csv
│   └── blogs/
│       └── getting-started-with-agentic-coding.md
```

### 4. Test the Charts

1. Visit: `https://timillguth.com/getting-started-with-agentic-coding`
2. Scroll to "Real-World Productivity Gains" → Should see **bar chart**
3. Scroll to "Cost-Benefit Analysis" → Should see **pie chart**
4. Hover over charts → Should show **tooltips**
5. Try dark mode toggle → Charts should **adapt colors**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If charts show "Loading chart..." forever:

1. **Check CSV files uploaded:**
   - Open Hostinger File Manager
   - Navigate to `public_html/content/data/`
   - Verify both CSV files are present

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 on your website
   - Look for errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for failed CSV requests

3. **Check .htaccess:**
   - Verify `.htaccess` uploaded to `public_html/`
   - Should contain: `AddType text/csv .csv`

4. **Check file permissions:**
   - CSV files should be: **644**
   - Directories should be: **755**

### If you see JavaScript errors:

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Verify all files in `assets/` folder uploaded
3. Check that `BlogPost-*.js` file is present (includes chart code)

## 📊 Chart Data

If you want to update the chart data in the future:

### Cost Savings Chart (`Cost_Savings_Piechart.csv`):
```csv
,Unnamed
Monthly Tool Cost,35
Time Value Saved,900
```

### Hours Savings Chart (`Hours_Savings_Barchart.csv`):
```csv
,Before Agentic Coding (hours),After Agentic Coding (hours)
API Endpoint,2.5,0.75
Component Refactoring,5,1.75
Codebase Comprehension,1.5,0.33
```

**To update:** Edit the CSV files in `/public/content/data/`, rebuild, and redeploy.

## 🎨 Technical Details

### Libraries Used:
- **Recharts 3.3.0** - Chart rendering
- **React 18.3.1** - Component framework
- All bundled in the `BlogPost` component

### How It Works:
1. Markdown contains markers: `[CostSavingsChart]` and `[HoursSavingsChart]`
2. BlogPost component renders these as React components
3. Chart components fetch CSV data via HTTP
4. Recharts renders interactive SVG visualizations

### Performance:
- Charts load asynchronously (don't block page load)
- CSV files are tiny (< 200 bytes each)
- Charts are bundled with code splitting
- Total bundle size increase: ~100KB gzipped (Recharts library)

## ✨ Benefits

Your blog post now includes:
- **Professional data visualization** - More engaging than text/tables
- **Interactive experience** - Readers can explore the data
- **Modern tech presentation** - Shows you know modern web dev
- **Reusable system** - Easy to add more charts to future posts

## 🔮 Future Chart Usage

To add charts to other blog posts:

1. Create CSV file in `/public/content/data/your-data.csv`
2. Create chart component in `/src/components/charts/YourChart.tsx`
3. Register it in `BlogPost.tsx` custom renderer
4. Use `[YourChart]` marker in markdown

The system is now set up for easy chart additions!
